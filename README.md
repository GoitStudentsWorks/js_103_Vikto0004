# About the Project

In a world where digital presence becomes a professional's calling card, we, as
GoIT students, were given a unique challenge - to build a full-fledged personal
website from scratch. This project not only allowed us to apply all the
knowledge and skills we've acquired but also taught us how to work in a team,
mirroring real-world work environments.

Our approach was to create a site for a fictional character, Lloyd Jefferson,
envisioning him as an experienced full-stack developer. This gave us the freedom
to approach design and content creatively while adhering to web development best
practices.
